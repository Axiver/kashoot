# kashoot

Do you hate the player limit of Kahoot! games? Or the fact that they're so prone to spam bots?
Worry no more because kashoot is here. With this clone of Kahoot!, it _kashoots_ those problems away. Gone are the days of lobby flooding, gone are the days of only being able to have 1200 players in your Kahoot! lobby. Now, the only limitation is your home computer/server that this is being hosted on, because this repo contains both the server and the client for **kashoot**, making the possibilities endless.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Installing for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Node.js and npm (which comes with Node.js) to run the server.

[Download Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You will also need a webserver of your choice, such as [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)

A SSL Connection to the server is mandatory, so you'll need to use a service like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

### Installing
#### Node packages

After downloading Node.js and npm, `cd` into the directory you installed the bot to and run `npm i`. It should automatically install all the needed modules for this bot to work.
