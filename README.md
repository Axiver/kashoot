# kashoot

This is a lightweight and fast clone of Kahoot! written from the ground-up that _kashoots_ all the flaws Kahoot! has away. This includes but is not limited to, bot immunity, no player limit, and a whole lot more.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Installing for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Node.js and npm (which comes with Node.js) to run the server.

[Download Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

MongoDB is required, so you will need to install that.

[Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

You will also need a webserver of your choice, such as [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)

A SSL Connection to the server is mandatory, so you'll need to use a service like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

### Installing
#### Node packages

After downloading Node.js and npm, `cd` into the directory you installed the bot to and run `npm i`. It should automatically install all the needed modules for this bot to work.
